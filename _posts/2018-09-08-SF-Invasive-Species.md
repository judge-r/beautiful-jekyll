title: SF Invasive Species Guide
---
The following pdf is an invasive plant species brochure that I made (along with two of my former classmates at Northeastern) in my Advanced Writing in the Sciences class. It is an educational guide designed to inform laypeople about the risks invasive species present to ecosystems and steps that can be taken to remove them. The guide is formatted as a tri-fold brochure.

The guide is meant to educate the public about the risks of invasive species on local ecosystems while also pointing out that the removal of Spartina may be more detrimental to the ecosystem in certain cases due to its ability to serve as nesting habitat for endangered birds. Small, concise educational materials like this are great for educating the public on local scientific/natural resource issues. I hope you enjoy!

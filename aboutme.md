# What I have been up to lately: #

## My Job! ##

I have been in the Philadelphia, PA area working for about 9 months with Normandeau Associates, an environmental consulting firm that specializes mostly in ecological work related to fish, bats, freshwater mussels, soil, and groundwater. We work with both public and private clients under federal, state, and local environmental regulations. As I continue with my work, I am excited to learn more about the environmental issues of the region.

## Learning how to Code ##

Over the past two years, I have been teaching myself how to code in several different languages including: C/C++, R, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I knew absolutely no programming at all before I started my research project as a senior at Northeastern. I wanted to learn after realizing how valuable it can be for research consulting. In my opinion, basic programming should be a core class requirement for all STEM majors in higher education. I learned enough programming to get this website up and running, and I am excited to continue developing my skills.

## Running ##

I like to run and train for road races when I can. I am currently training for the 2019 Beach to Beacon 10k in August. You can follow my training on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11975000). I also enjoy watching professional running including the [World Marathon Majors](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/), [IAAF Diamond League](https://www.diamondleague.com/home/), World Championships, and Olympics of course.

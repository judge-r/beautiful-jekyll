title: My First Publication
subtitle: A literature review on intertidal datalogging methods and technologies
---
My first ever peer-reviewed publication was just published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution! A product of my undergraduate research, this paper is the first of its kind. It offers a thorough review of intertidal datalogging methods and associated technologies that have been used around the world by several research groups. 

This paper is open-access and hopefully will serve as a helpful resource for marine ecologists and physiologists who use intertidal datalogging in their experiments. You can access the paper [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00213/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Ecology_and_Evolution&id=417260)

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me for more information, or the corresponding author, Dr. Brian Helmuth at his email address listed on the cover.

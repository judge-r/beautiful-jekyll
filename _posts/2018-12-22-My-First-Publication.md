title: My First Publication
subtitle: A literature review on intertidal data logging methods and technologies
---
My first ever peer-reviewed publication was just published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution! A product of my undergraduate research, this paper is the first of its kind. It offers a thorough review of intertidal data logging methods and associated technologies that have been used around the world by several research groups. 

This paper is open-access and hopefully will serve as a helpful resource for marine ecologists and physiologists who use intertidal data logging in their experiments. You can access the paper [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00213/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Ecology_and_Evolution&id=417260).

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me for more information, or the corresponding author, Dr. Brian Helmuth at his email address listed on the cover.

Please also see the comprehensive timeline graphic that I made below using Adobe Illustrator. Although we decided not to use this visual in the paper, it is a good summary of the key publications in this field and shows how both the technology and methods have evolved over the years. I have cited all the papers included in the graphic below for your reference.

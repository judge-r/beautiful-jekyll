title: The Future of U.S. Energy
subtitle: Emerging trends in the U.S. energy sector
---
As the United States begins a new year, there will be significant advances in energy efficiency programs and renewable energy markets in line with many of the same trends from years past. Due to long-term market forces that are only partially constrained by changes in federal energy policy, the cost per kilowatt-hour of solar and wind is dropping rapidly. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects solar energy to continue to grow due to low costs, even after the Solar Investment Tax Credit expires in 2024 (U.S. EIA 2019). This effect, coupled with declines in natural gas prices, is projected to increase costs of baseload coal and nuclear energy operators (U.S. EIA 2019). Natural gas and renewables are projected to grow to compose 39% and 31% of U.S. energy generation by 2050, respectively. However, it is important to note that these projections from the AEO 2019 report are based on current estimates of fuel availability, changes in technology costs, and current legislation (Knight 2019). Projections from this annual report, therefore, often vary from year to year. If federal, state, and even local legislation changes substantially in future years to affect the other factors, these projections will also shift as a result.

The following graphic is a handy visual that shows both the breakdown in energy production between sources, and the further breakdown of how those energy sources power different sectors in the U.S. in 2017:

A major market to be developed in the United States is that of offshore wind, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard. New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are leading the way with plans to install 3,500, 2,400, and 3,200 MW of offshore wind power by 2030 (for NJ and NY, and 2035 (for MA). Both land-based and offshore wind is expected to generate about 404 GW of power in the United States, while creating 600,000 jobs by 2050 (U.S. DOE 2015). Under an optimistic market scenario of low wind costs and comparatively high fossil-fuel prices, wind power could contribute up to 40% of total power generation in the U.S. by 2050 (U.S. DOE 2015).

Another fuel source that shows some potential is the renewable hydrogen energy supply chain. Hydrogen extraction via steam reforming of natural gas or electrolysis powered by renewable sources are two ways in which this fuel can be developed in a relatively clean process (low emissions and little solid waste production, Schneider et al. 2010). Hydrogen fuel cell powered cars are more efficient than those with internal combustion engines and much less dirty. However, hydrogen itself is expensive and difficult to store and thus presents difficulties over other forms of clean energy production such as wind and solar.

Low fuel prices over the last several years has led to increases in energy consumption and emissions by the transportation sector. There is a high consumer demand for more fuel-intensive SUVs and trucks as a result. Jet fuel consumption is expected to rise 35% from 2018 to 2050 under current projections (U.S. EIA 2019). There are, however, research and development projects by both automobile and aircraft companies into electric vehicles and increased investment in electric charging infrastructure by 3rd party businesses. Globally, auto manufacturers are expected to invest at least $90 billion in electric and hybrid vehicle development (Lienert 2018). Many companies, including several in China, are hoping to compete with Tesla in this market. Electric vehicles are still partially limited by battery technology. Due to constraints on battery weight, size, and efficiency, engineering electric aircraft is an incredibly difficult task. As of right now, there is some intriguing research on magnesium, lithium-sulfur, sodium ion, and solid-state batteries. A breakthrough in any of these technologies would have significant implications for both the electric car and aircraft development markets. Currently, the more viable approach to powering airplanes with lower emissions is with the development of viable biofuels. 

According to Nature, second-generation biofuels are developed by lignocellulosic biomass sources including grasses, crops, and forest waste (nature). The primary focus of research into second-generation biofuels is in the development of genetically engineered enzymes that can facilitate the breakdown of lignin into a refine-able form. Third-generation biofuels are developed from microalgae and cyanobacteria. The amount of oils produced by these sources depends on the availability of CO2 and sunlight so there must be proper development and planning of pond-farms and photobioreactors (Davidson 2008). If these fuels can become viable and then scaled up to accommodate large transportation sectors, they may be able to fuel cars and airplanes in the future.

Energy efficiency standards, in general, have become more stringent and widespread in the U.S. Examples include automobile corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, building efficiency standards, and appliance efficiency standards. California leads the nation in energy efficiency. The state met its 2020 carbon emissions goal of reductions below 1990 levels in 2016, 4 years early. This was due, in large part to increases in the use of energy efficiency technologies such as adaptive lighting controls, aerosol duct sealing, building performance controls, data center cooling, and tartrate removal from wine (Energy.ca.gov 2018). New and emerging technologies include: magnetized refrigerators that consume 25% less energy, dishwashers with soil sensors that avoid excessive washing, vuilleumer heat pumps, smart thermostats, and CO2-polymer insulation among many others in development (Electricchoice.com). These improvements will help decrease energy consumption and save significant costs.

These are just some of the many trends that are occurring in the American energy sector. As laws change and technology improves, the rate at which these changes occur can either increase or decrease. The complexity of the energy sector is immense. Careful planning and research can help governments, companies, and households manage changing energy trends.

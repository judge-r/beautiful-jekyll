title: About Me
---
I am currently an alum of Northeastern University. I am an experienced environmental science and policy graduate with a strong interest in public and private sector policy work. I am currently seeking an entry-level position related to science communication, public policy research, or renewable energy in the Boston area. My quality work reflects a diverse skill set founded on strong organizational skills and a passion for political issues.

A native of the great state of Maine, I am an outdoorsman at my core. My favorite hike is the Cathedral Trail on Mount Katahdin and I have spent many summers fishing and camping in the North Maine Woods. In my spare time, I also like to run, ski, sail, and scuba dive. I also enjoy playing the piano as relaxation. In the future, I hope to continue studying piano and improving my skills and technique.

The year 2018 will stand among many others as a time of extreme and volatile weather patterns that, when viewed in a larger context, reveal significant changes in climate. 2018 was the 4th warmest year on record with an average global temperature of about 1°C above the global average during the pre-industrial period (1850-1900) (World Meteorological Organization 2018). This figure stands out in particular because of its significance within the larger context of climate change mitigation efforts through the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. The industrialized global community is now about halfway to the global warming limit of 2°C and two-thirds of the way to the more aggressive pathway of 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial levels defined by the Accords (UNFCCC 2015). Leading scientists and policymakers have agreed that limiting warming to no more than 2°C will likely limit the most catastrophic climate change consequences including: excessive food and water shortages, high-frequency supercharged storms, and excessive droughts.

In 2018, the Arctic continued to show signs of warming consistent with those of the past several decades. Surface air temperatures continued increasing roughly two to three times as fast as the rest of the world (known as “Arctic Amplification”) and sea ice extent continued at record lows (IPCC 2018). The resulting gaps in sea ice yielded anomalously high measurements of primary productivity of about 500% greater than normal levels (Osborne et al. 2018). The once frozen-over swaths of the Arctic Ocean have now occasionally shown primary productivity levels typically seen in the temperate oceans.

The most worrisome scientific conclusions from 2018 were published in two high-profile reports: (1) the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5°C Warming and (2) the U.S. 4th National Climate Assessment. These conclusions warn that global society must reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050 in order to limit warming to 1.5°C (IPCC 2018). Furthermore, only an unprecedented global energy transition coupled with multiple carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies, such as reforestation, would make this possible. Meeting this goal is now widely regarded by scientists as extremely difficult both due to political constraints and the short timeline with which this transition would need to occur. Inaction on climate change is expected to result in significant net negative economic losses over time as well. In fact, 21 countries have successfully reduced their emissions while growing GDP in the period from 2000 to 2014 (Aden 2016), proving that economic growth can be decoupled from emissions.

In the coming decade, signatories of the Paris Climate Accords and the United States will take bolder actions on energy and conservation issues than in past years. The largest greenhouse gas emitters, including the U.S., China, and India will accelerate both public and private energy transitions from coal, oil, and natural gas to wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, biomass, and nuclear energy. There will be more research and investment into battery technology, grid energy storage based on variable supply and demand, and advanced biofuels. Large food systems, particularly the meat industry, will need to do its part to cut-back emissions and invest in research and development of synthetic beef and poultry. Perhaps most importantly, devastating levels of deforestation must be reversed particularly in the countries of most concern currently: Colombia, Brazil, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, to name a few. Global warming cannot be mitigated unless there are meaningful emissions reductions coupled with avoided deforestation, afforestation, reforestation and likely other carbon dioxide removal efforts. The future is inherently difficult to predict, however the solutions to the climate crisis are in our hands.

Thanks for reading,

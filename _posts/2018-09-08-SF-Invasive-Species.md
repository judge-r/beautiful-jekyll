title: SF Invasive Species Guide
---
  The following pdf is an invasive plant species guide that I made (along with two of my former classmates at Northeastern) in my Advanced Writing in the Sciences class. It is an educational guide designed to inform laypeople about the risks invasive species present to ecosystems and steps that can be taken to remove them.

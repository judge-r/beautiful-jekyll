## My New Job! ##

I just moved to the Philadelphia, PA area to begin a new job with Normandeau Associates, an environmental consulting firm that specializes mostly in ecological work related to fish, bats, freshwater mussels, soil, groundwater, and impacts from new energy development. We work with clients under federal, state, and local environmental regulations to help them gain compliance with those laws. As I continue with my work, I am excited to learn more about the environmental issues of the region.

## Mussel Research ##

In August 2018, I finished up a research project in [Dr. Brian Helmuthâ€™s lab](http://www.northeastern.edu/helmuthlab/index.html) at the [Northeastern University Marine Science Center](https://cos.northeastern.edu/marinescience/). I designed, built, and tested a biomimetic mussel bed. More information about the project can be found in this [article](https://nuscimag.com/what-use-is-a-fake-mussel-bed-d5b3d8c9abf2) I wrote for NUSCI magazine or my recent [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00213/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Ecology_and_Evolution&id=417260) that was published this past December in the journal "Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution". The code available for the logger can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/judge-r).

## Learning how to Code ##

Over the past two years, I have been teaching myself how to code in several different languages including: C/C++, R, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I knew absolutely no programming at all before I started my research project as a senior at Northeastern. I wanted to learn after realizing how valuable it can be for research consulting. In my opinion, basic programming should be a core class requirement for all STEM majors in higher education. I learned enough programming to get this website up and running, and I am excited to continue developing my skills.

## Running ##

I like to run and train for road races when I can. I am currently training for the 2019 Beach to Beacon 10k in August. You can follow my training on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11975000). I also enjoy watching professional running including the [World Marathon Majors](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/), [IAAF Diamond League](https://www.diamondleague.com/home/), World Championships, and Olympics of course.

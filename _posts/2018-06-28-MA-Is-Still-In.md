title: MA Is Still In
subtitle: How Recent Legislation Poises the State to Lead on Climate
---
A number of very important pieces of climate legislation have been introduced in the last year and are making their way through the Massachusetts General Court now. 

The relatively new Massachusetts Climate Omnibus Bill ([S. 2545](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/S2545)), called "An Act to promote a clean energy future: *To protect our public health, create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions*" is now one of the most comprehensive legislative efforts to fight climate change in Massachusetts history. The Senate version of the bill passed on June 14 and is now in the House where it will face tougher scrutiny. The bill is an ambitious and much needed attempt to address climate change which is becoming costlier to society by the day. It will help to enforce the state’s [2008 Global Warming Solutions Act](https://www.mass.gov/progress-towards-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions) (GWSA) by ensuring that intermediate emissions reduction targets are being achieved through the years 2030 and 2040. 

According to a [review](https://cabaus.org/2018/02/12/senate-clean-energy-omnibus-bill/) by the Climate Action Business Association (CABA) some of the main objectives of the bill are to:

- Require the implementation of a “market-based compliance mechanism” (such as cap and trade or, more preferably, a carbon tax) for the transportation, residential building, and industrial sectors
- Ensure that the emission-reduction goals of the Global Warming Solutions Act are to be met by setting 2030 and 2040 intermediate reduction targets
- Eliminate the cap on net metering which will incentivize the creation of additional public and private solar projects all around the state and make them more attractive to homeowners
- Initiate a grant program to assist regional agencies in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies 
- Provide access to low-cost renewable energy for low-income people

Two goals of the GWSA are to reduce annual emissions to 25% and 80% below statewide annual emissions from 1990 by the years 2020 and 2050, respectively. That 1990 target was updated most recently by the state in a [2015 report](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/uo/cecp-for-2020.pdf) to 94.4 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions. Below I have graphed annual emissions from past data (1990-2014) and used basic linear interpolation to predict what future emissions should be to achieve the 2020 (70.8 million metric tons CO2) and 2050 (18.9 million metric tons CO2) targets:

Under this linear scenario, it appears that we can expect the 2030 and 2040 emissions targets to be approximately 53.5 and 36.2 million metric tons CO2, respectively. However, due to a variety of factors which may be difficult to predict, future emissions may be better modeled by exponential decay if clean energy grows at an increasing rate along with electric vehicle use and others. The growth of renewable energy in Massachusetts has not only reduced emissions since 1990, it has reduced the percentage of emissions by electricity usage around the state:

In terms of international climate commitments, the MA Climate Omnibus Bill will help the state contribute to the emissions reduction goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement which aims to keep the average global temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Although the federal government withdrew from Paris in 2017, cities, states, and businesses are committing to uphold the agreement through the [We Are Still In](https://www.americaspledgeonclimate.com/) movement. Similarly, although the Environmental Protection Agency has now issued a pending repeal of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan – another policy initiative directed at forcing states to curb U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, Governor Charlie Baker has [stated](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/massachusetts/articles/2017-10-10/massachusetts-committed-to-obama-era-clean-power-plan) his commitment to its objectives. Massachusetts faces many looming climate threats including [rapidly warming coastal waters](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/gulf-of-maine-warming-faster-than-99-of-world-s-oceans-study-1.2753983) and [up to 7.3 feet of sea level rise](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zwznes9jin41i5k/Feasibility%20of%20Harbor-wide%20Barriers%20Report.pdf?dl=0) by the year 2100. This new climate bill presents a chance to take bold actions on emissions reductions and simultaneous climate adaptation that are desperately needed.

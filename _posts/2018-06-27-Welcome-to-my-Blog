Hi all,

I have just started my own personal website and I am very excited to share my thoughts on a wide variety of issues. My intent is to inform my readers about my views on U.S. and global politics, science and technology, and my career aspirations. I hope you find this content engaging and I hope I may be able to get my audience to think about complex issues in rather unique ways.

I will be posting whenever I can and I hope you all find this interesting. If you have any comments or questions, please reach out and I would be happy to respond. I want this blog to be a positive environment for dialogue on a wide variety of topics and I encourage all of you to actively participate.

Thank you for viewing,

Richard

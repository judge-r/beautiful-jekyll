## Mussel Research ##

Currently, I am finishing up a research project in [Dr. Brian Helmuthâ€™s lab](http://www.northeastern.edu/helmuthlab/index.html)at the [Northeastern University Marine Science Center](https://cos.northeastern.edu/marinescience/). I am designing, building, and testing a biomimetic mussel bed. More information about the project can be found in this [article](https://nuscimag.com/what-use-is-a-fake-mussel-bed-d5b3d8c9abf2) I wrote for NUSCI magazine. Pardon the few grammatical mistakes! The code available for the logger can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/judge-r).

## This Website & Learning how to Code ##

Over the past year or so, I have been teaching myself how to code in several different languages including: C/C++, R, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wish I had taken a computer science class or two while in school because I still do not know how I got away with being a science major and not being required to take a programming class. I knew absolutely no programming at all before I started my research project and realized I wanted to learn after realizing how valuable it is in many fields. In my opinion, basic programming should be a core class requirement for all STEM majors in higher education. I learned enough programming to get this website up and running, and I am excited to continue learning.

## Running ##

I like to run and train for road races when I can. You can follow my training on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11975000). I also enjoy watching professional running including the [World Marathon Majors](https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/), [IAAF Diamond League](https://www.diamondleague.com/home/), World Championships, and Olympics of course.
